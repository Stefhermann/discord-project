# Inspiration
This is a fun project for me to learn new things about the next.js framework and dive deeper into the full-stack development world. 

# What is it
A team chat application that allows you to communicate with others through messagine, audio call, and video call. 
Users are able to create servers where they can chat with multiple people at the same time and send messages to a groupchat like enviornment. 
They are also able to customize their own server and give members roles like Admin, Moderator, and Member.
